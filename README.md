### Wiring

This assignment does't have wiring  

### Code
 import time
import board 

for counter in range (10,0,-1): # counts from 10 to 0
    print(counter) # this shows it countng down in the terminal



### Reflection
Something that was challeging for me at first was what to put for the code because I don't have the basic understanding of python coding.I learned a better 
understanding on the code and how it works.This will help me remember what I did and how to do it in the future if I have to do it a couple months from now.

### Code
Give me a link to your code. [Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py). Don't make me hunt through your folders, give me a nice link to click to take me there! Remember to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection
In this assignment I learned the hard way on don't plug it in to power without a reseistor because it burns the led.I got a better understanding on led's and the code 
that works them.I learned more about Rasberry pi and how they work and a better understanding on the pins.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code
Give me a link to your code. [Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py). Don't make me hunt through your folders, give me a nice link to click to take me there! Remember to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
## FEA 1

### Assignment Description

In this assignment we have to build a beam that can hold the most weight possible.We can't use angles over 45 deg because it is getting 3d printed.This assignment is going to be fun.

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

In this assignment I messed up alot.I would make the thickness to wide on the support and then touch it up before I checked the weight.I did this twice which really messed me up and I did't have a good design because of it.If I had to do this assignment I again I would focus on the weight first.

## FEA 3

### Assignment Description

In this assignment we are testing are beams.This is going to be a stress test on are beams through onshape.This is going to hep me and my partner improve are beams.

Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it.

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection
In the beam that I made all the pressure was on the top of it not spread out at all.It was a bad design that we didn't use for the test.Because of the test we figure the other one we alot woud be way better.
